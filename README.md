Great question. The current list **does cover all the major multithreading concepts**, but to ensure **completeness and stronger conceptual depth**, here's a refined version of the problem set. I've replaced 6 questions to include **Phaser, ThreadLocal, Future vs CompletableFuture, ThreadGroup, and Virtual Threads (Project Loom)**â€”important additions in modern Java (Java 8+ and Java 21+).

### âœ… **Finalized 50 Java Multithreading Problems â€“ Basic to Advanced**

#### ðŸŸ¢ **Basic (1â€“15) â€“ Thread Creation, Lifecycle, Basics**

1. Create a thread by extending the `Thread` class.
2. Create a thread by implementing the `Runnable` interface.
3. Print numbers from 1 to 10 using two threads.
4. Set name and priority of a thread and print it.
5. Demonstrate thread life cycle with logs (`NEW`, `RUNNABLE`, etc.).
6. Use `Thread.sleep()` and observe behavior.
7. Create multiple threads and start them simultaneously.
8. Demonstrate thread joining using `join()`.
9. Use `isAlive()` to check if a thread is still running.
10. Create a daemon thread and explain its behavior.
11. Demonstrate thread interruption with `interrupt()` and `isInterrupted()`.
12. Create a thread using `ExecutorService` and `Callable`.
13. Submit multiple `Callable` tasks and collect results with `invokeAll`.
14. Demonstrate proper shutdown of an `ExecutorService`.
15. Create a fixed thread pool with `Executors.newFixedThreadPool()`.

#### ðŸŸ¡ **Intermediate (16â€“35) â€“ Synchronization, Concurrency Utilities**

16. Demonstrate race condition with multiple threads incrementing a shared counter.
17. Solve race condition using `synchronized` keyword.
18. Use synchronized block with a shared lock object.
19. Use `ReentrantLock` to implement explicit locking.
20. Implement producer-consumer using `wait()` and `notify()`.
21. Implement producer-consumer using `BlockingQueue`.
22. Show usage of `volatile` to ensure visibility.
23. Use `AtomicInteger` for lock-free counter.
24. Create a deadlock scenario between two threads.
25. Prevent deadlock using lock ordering strategy.
26. Print even and odd numbers using two threads alternately.
27. Use `CountDownLatch` to wait for threads to complete.
28. Synchronize tasks using `CyclicBarrier`.
29. Control access to a resource using `Semaphore`.
30. Demonstrate use of `ReentrantReadWriteLock`.
31. Simulate concurrent file access by multiple threads.
32. Use `ThreadLocal` to provide per-thread variable storage. âœ… _(New Addition)_
33. Implement a thread-safe Singleton (Double-checked locking).
34. Create a simple custom ThreadPool using `BlockingQueue`.
35. Compare `Future` and `CompletableFuture` for async tasks. âœ… _(New Addition)_

42. Build a rate limiter using tokens and synchronized blocks.
43. Implement parallel merge sort using Fork/Join framework.
44. Use `Phaser` to synchronize multiple phases of threads. âœ… _(New Addition)_
45. Simulate dining philosophers using `ReentrantLock` or `Semaphore`.

47. Build a job scheduler with delayed task queue.
48. Compare `ThreadGroup` and `ExecutorService`. âœ… _(New Addition)_
49. Implement an event-driven system using producer-consumer model.
50. Create and use Virtual Threads (Project Loom) for concurrency. âœ… _(New Addition for Java 21+)_

### ðŸ§  Concepts Covered:

- Thread basics (`Thread`, `Runnable`)
- Thread lifecycle and control (`sleep`, `join`, `isAlive`, `interrupt`)
- Synchronization (`synchronized`, locks, `Atomic` variables)
- Concurrency utilities (`CountDownLatch`, `Semaphore`, `BlockingQueue`, `Phaser`, etc.)
- Advanced structures (`ThreadLocal`, Fork/Join, CompletableFuture, Virtual Threads)
- Design patterns (producer-consumer, thread-safe singleton, rate limiter, event-driven)
- Deadlock, starvation, and race conditions
